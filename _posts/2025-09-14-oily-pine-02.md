title: Oily Pine - Chapter 2 (So many logs)
post:
  excerpt: "What to do with 1000 failed packages?"
---

This is the second article in a mini series of 3 Blog posts:
- [How to build all packages of Alpine Linux with a new Shell?]({{ site.baseurl}}/oily-pine-01)
- What to do with 1000 failed packages?
- Epilogue

## Analyze and Categorize

In the [last article]({{ site.baseurl}}/oily-pine-01) I've shown how to set up a container image to build a few thousand Alpine Linux packages (using Oils).
I've ended the article with an initial try at building as many packages as possible, where I built 5327 out of 6500 packages until the disk filled up.

This also means 1173 packages *failed*.

Even before my disk ran full and the build stopped, I started looking into some logs trying to find and reproduce actual Oils bugs manually. I analyzed a few logs and quickly realized a few things:
- The same or similar errors seem to happen repeatedly
- It takes a LONG time to do a deeper analysis of an issue
- If a bug occurs in 100 builds, I’d rather focus on that one than another one happening in maybe 3 package builds.

So after taking a look at ca. 10 log files, I decided to find a way to quickly *categorize* the 1173 logs. And what could be better to churn through so much text than a machine?... **AI?!** I've never had a real "I *need* AI for that" use case, but this sounded like the perfect opportunity! I really don't want to look at all these logs myself.

So I whipped up a small script to send the last 40 lines of a logfile to ChatGPT and try to summarize the problem in *maximum 5 words*. Sorry for throwing ysh at you, but it shouldn’t be too hard to understand that script. Ysh just has a few features which made these 13 lines of code a bit extra nice:

```bash
# simplified categorization-script

#!/usr/bin/env ysh

# *generate a list of log files with errors*
var bad_log_files = $(
  ... grep ^ERROR @[glob("~/oily-pine/oily/logs/*log")]
  | tr -d ":"
  | awk '{ print $3 }'
)

for file in (bad_log_files => split(u'\n')) {
  ... cat ./PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md
      # Ignore all lines from abuild removing packages at the end
    <(... grep -v "Purging" $file | head -n -1
      # the error should be in the last few lines.
      # chatgpt can't handle too much input!
      | tail -40
      ;)
    | chatgpt
    | tr -d u'\n'
    >> $out_file;

  # Add a newline
  echo >> $out_file
}
````

So let's go through each part individually.

```bash
var bad_log_files = $(
  ... grep ^ERROR @[glob("~/oily-pine/oily/logs/*log")]
  | tr -d ":"
  | awk '{ print $3 }'
)
```

This is how to define a variable in Ysh. Notice that I can have a space before and after the `=`. Because it behaves like an assignment in e.g. Python or Javascript, etc.


  ... grep ^ERROR @[glob("~/oily-pine/oily/logs/*log")]
  | tr -d ":"
  | awk '{ print $3 }'
) => split(u'\n')
```



```ysh
for file in (bad_log_files => split(u'\n')) {

}
```

In `ysh` that's how a `for` loop looks. Inside of the `()` ysh enters a so-called *expression-mode*, which behaves like Python or Javascript. `bad_log_files` is a list of logfiles (as a string), on which I use the function `split`, to separate it into an array of strings. Another way to write it is `split(bad_log_files, u'\n')`.

The script joins the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` and 40 lines of the logfile together, sends them to chatgpt and removes any newlines in the chatgpt output (which shouldn’t be more than 5 words anyway!!1!)

I installed the `chatgpt` cli with the following command:

```
curl -L -o chatgpt https://github.com/kardolus/chatgpt-cli/releases/latest/download/chatgpt-linux-amd64 && chmod +x chatgpt && sudo mv chatgpt /usr/local/bin/
```

That's really not how I usually install software, and I urge you to not copy-paste this command. But after trying a few other chatgpt (and claude) cli tools this worked and so I just stuck with it.

chatgpt also wants an access token, so I used

I’m not a prompt Engineer. So I literally just copied a prompt from a random blog post and adjusted it to fit my need. It's probably heavily overengineered for its usecase, and maybe having one sentence describe the task might'be been better. But I enjoyed the overengineering:

```markdown
# IDENTITY and CATEGORY
You are a genius error message categorization expert and you are able to understand and categorize errors from software being compiled for Linux.
You specialize in extracting the relevant error messages from a log file and create a very brief category for the error.
Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best possible results by following the steps below.

You have no knowledge on what to do with the error message. Your only purpose is to categorize it.

# STEPS
Read the entire log file from an attempted package compilation, trying to identify the exact log line containing the error message which causes the build to fail.
Come up with a description of this error type which is not more than 5 words, to be used as CATEGORY-DESCRIPTION.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
Only output a single line of plain text.

Do not give warnings or notes; only output the requested 5 words.
Do not try to give a solution to the error.
You can only output a single sentence of 5 words.
Ensure you follow ALL these instructions when creating your output.

# INPUT
Logs:
```

And it worked (mostly)! :)
I only categorized ~500 logs from the `main` repo to not spend too much money initially. Then I created some stats to see how often Chatgpt used the same "5" words. I won't spare the details:

      1 it seems like there were errors during the build process of the mpfr4 library. the errors indicate that the linker input file specified as "\\\-dlt_objdir=".libs/" was not found, resulting in the build failure.to address this issue, you may need to review the build configuration and ensure that the paths and flags provided to the compiler and linker are correct. specifically, check the way the output directory is specified and make sure it aligns with the structure expected by the build system.you may also want to review the makefile or the build scripts to see how the paths and flags are being set and adjust as needed. additionally, checking for any missing or incorrect dependencies that could be causing the linker input file not to be generated properly may be necessary.once you have reviewed and updated the build configuration accordingly, you can retry the build process to see if the issue has been resolved. if you encounter any further difficulties or need additional assistance, feel free to provide more details so i can offer more specific guidance.
      1 it seems like there were errors during the build process for `cgit`. the error message indicates problems with the ld linker related to the segments' permissions. here are a few suggestions to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:1. **check load and phdr segments permissions**: review the linker script, object files, or options used during compilation and linking to ensure that the load segment permissions align with the phdr segment. make sure there are no conflicting permissions defined.2. **investigate ld warnings**: examine any warnings or notes produced by the ld linker. it may provide additional insights into the segmentation issues encountered during linking.3. **review linker options**: verify that the linker options and flags are correctly set during the linking phase. check if there are any conflicting or incorrect options that might cause the segmentation errors.4. **inspect build logs**: review the complete build logs to identify any earlier warnings or errors that could have led to the segmentation issues during linking. addressing any previous build problems might help resolve the current linker errors.5. **consult build dependencies**: ensure that all build dependencies, including libraries and headers, are correctly installed and accessible. sometimes, missing or incompatible dependencies can lead to linker issues.6. **compiler and linker version compatibility**: make sure that the compiler and linker versions are compatible. incompatibilities between the compiler and linker versions could lead to segmentation problems during linking.7. **seek help from the project community**: if troubleshooting the issue locally proves challenging, consider reaching out to the cgit project community or relevant forums for assistance. other developers might have encountered and resolved similar issues.by following these steps and investigating the build process further, you may be able to identify and address the root cause of the segmentation issues encountered during the linking phase of building `cgit`.
      1 it seems like there was an issue during the compilation process, resulting in the termination of the make commands. this can be caused by various factors, such as incorrect configurations, missing dependencies, or errors in the source code.to troubleshoot and resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:1. check for any error messages or warnings displayed during the compilation. these messages can provide clues about what went wrong.2. verify that all dependencies required for the compilation are properly installed on your system. make sure that all the necessary libraries and tools are available.3. review the source code files mentioned in the error messages, such as `_dd_to_di.c` and `_dd_to_usi.c`, to see if there are any syntax errors or other issues in the code.4. check the makefile and ensure that the build configurations are correct. make sure that the paths to include directories and libraries are set up properly.5. clean the build environment by running `make clean` and then try to rebuild the project using `make`.6. if the issue persists, you may need to seek help from the project's community or maintainers for further assistance.by following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and address the compilation issues to successfully build the project. if you encounter any specific errors or need further assistance, feel free to provide more details for a more targeted solution.
      1 it seems like there was an error during the build process of the program "ifupdown". specifically, the error message indicates issues with phdr segment not covered by load segment and a warning about rwx permissions.to address these errors, you may want to review the linker options related to the phdr segment and the permissions of the load segment. additionally, it could be beneficial to check the linker options being used and ensure they are compatible with the target system.if you need further assistance or guidance on resolving these build errors, feel free to provide more information or details about the target system and the build environment.
      1 it looks like there was an error during the installation process of the libxcb package. the error occurred while trying to install the man pages for the libxcb library. specifically, the error is related to the installation of the man pages for the xvmc (x-video motion compensation) extension in xcb (x c bindings) library.to troubleshoot this issue, you may want to check the following:1. verify that the man page files mentioned in the error message exist and have the correct permissions.2. ensure that the paths specified for the installation of the man pages are correct.3. check the permissions and ownership of the directories where the man pages are being installed.4. review the build logs for any additional error messages that might provide more context on the issue.if you continue to encounter issues with the installation, you may need to consult the documentation or support resources for libxcb to troubleshoot this specific problem further.
      1 it looks like there was an error during the building process of the botan library. the error message indicates that there are issues related to the program headers (phdr) and load segments. additionally, there is a warning about a load segment having read, write, and execute (rwx) permissions, which may contribute to the issue.to diagnose and resolve this error, you may need to check the linker script, build configuration, or the way the library is being built. here are some steps you could follow to troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:1. **check the linker script**: review the linker script used during the build process. ensure that the phdr and load segments are properly defined and that the memory layout is correct.2. **review the build configuration**: double-check the compiler flags, linker options, and any scripts used during the build process. make sure that the options are appropriate for the target platform and that there are no conflicting settings causing the issue.3. **permissions of load segments**: as the warning indicated, having a load segment with rwx permissions can lead to issues. try to adjust the permissions to be more restrictive (e.g., removing the execute permission) if possible and necessary.4. **check for known issues**: search for any known issues or solutions related to the specific compiler, linker, or platform you are using. it's possible that others have encountered and documented similar issues.5. **build environment**: ensure that the build environment and toolchain are set up correctly for the target platform. inconsistent or incorrect configurations can lead to unexpected errors during the build process.6. **rebuild**: if you suspect that the error is due to a transient issue, try cleaning the build artifacts and rebuilding the library. sometimes, a fresh build can resolve intermittent problems.if the issue persists or if you need further assistance, feel free to provide more details about the build environment or any specific configurations you are using. this additional information can help in providing more targeted troubleshooting steps.
      1 it looks like the build process for the `cargo-auditable` project encountered errors and failed. the build script was unable to compile the dependencies `serde`, `proc-macro2`, `semver`, and `thiserror`.additionally, after the build failure, it seems an action to uninstall dependencies was triggered, specifically the uninstallation of `busybox-1.37.0-r12`.if you need help resolving the build errors or troubleshooting the issues with the project, please provide more details or specific error messages so that i can assist you further.
      1 it looks like the build process for `mdadm` encountered errors related to the linker, specifically issues with the phdr segment not being covered by the load segment, and the presence of a load segment with rwx permissions. these errors caused the build to fail for both `mdadm` and `mdmon`.to troubleshoot and resolve these issues, you may consider the following steps:1. **check build dependencies:**   ensure that all necessary dependencies for building `mdadm` are installed and up to date. sometimes missing or outdated dependencies can cause linker issues.2. **review build flags:**   review the linker flags and options used during the build process to ensure they are correct. make sure that the flags for stack protection, format security, and pie are set appropriately.3. **check compiler and linker versions:**   verify that the versions of the compiler (`gcc`) and linker (`ld`) being used are compatible with the build process. incompatibilities between tools can sometimes lead to linker errors.4. **investigate rwx permissions warning:**   the warning about a `load` segment with rwx permissions could indicate a potential security risk. review the linker options and the generated binary to ensure that the permissions are set correctly.5. **inspect binary output:**   after a failed build, it can be helpful to inspect the generated binary (`mdadm` and `mdmon`) to understand the structure and permissions of the segments. tools like `readelf` or `objdump` can be useful for this purpose.6. **look for relevant compiler and linker output:**   examine the full output from the compiler and linker to see if there are any other warnings or errors that might provide additional context about the failure.7. **search for similar issues:**   if the issue persists, consider searching online forums or issue trackers to see if others have encountered similar problems during the build of `mdadm`. solutions or workarounds from the community could help resolve the problem.by systematically addressing each of these points, you may be able to diagnose the cause of the linker errors and successfully build `mdadm` and `mdmon`. if you encounter any specific errors or need further assistance, feel free to provide additional details for tailored support.
      1 it looks like the build for `botan3` failed. the error message indicates that there was an issue with the `botan` binary, specifically related to phdr segment not being covered by load segment and the permissions associated with the load segment.to troubleshoot and resolve this issue, you may need to review the linker options, segment layout, and permissions set for the binary during the linking stage. double-check the linker flags (`-wl` options) and ensure that the binary is being linked correctly with the necessary segments and permissions.if you encounter this error, you may need to adjust the linker options or review the build process to ensure that the binary is being created correctly.if you need further assistance, please provide more details about the build environment, compiler options, and any custom settings that may be affecting the linking process.

Well that was surprising! Apparently there are only 2 major issues, a c compiler issue and a "phdr segment" issue. But since I just kinda forced you to scroll over the whole list, you might've been more surprised how chatgpt didn't always *exactly* follow the instructions of generating ***no more than 5 words***:

      1 it seems like there were errors during the build process of the mpfr4 library. the errors indicate that the linker input file specified as "\\\-dlt_objdir=".libs/" was not found, resulting in the build failure.to address this issue, you may need to review the build configuration and ensure that the paths and flags provided to the compiler and linker are correct. specifically, check the way the output directory is specified and make sure it aligns with the structure expected by the build system.you may also want to review the makefile or the build scripts to see how the paths and flags are being set and adjust as needed. additionally, checking for any missing or incorrect dependencies that could be causing the linker input file not to be generated properly may be necessary.once you have reviewed and updated the build configuration accordingly, you can retry the build process to see if the issue has been resolved. if you encounter any further difficulties or need additional assistance, feel free to provide more details so i can offer more specific guidance.

If you've already used chatgpt a bit, you might be able to guess why chatgpt returned slightly more than 5 words for the `mpfr4_library`. It becomes very apparent




I tried to reproduce this immediately by building a package by hand. The package built perfectly! I built a bunch of packages by hand without issues, which led me to the conclusion that something must be broken in the container!
