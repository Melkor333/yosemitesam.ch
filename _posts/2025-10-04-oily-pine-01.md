title: Oily Pine - Chapter 1
post:
  excerpt: "How to build packages of Alpine Linux with a custom Shell?"
---

I want to share a project I’ve been working on over the last year - I call it `Oily Pine`.

**Goal: Build all [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) packages with OSH from [Oils for Unix](https://oils.pub/) as shell.** Sounds easy, right?

This is the first in a mini series of 3 Blog posts:
- How to build packages of Alpine Linux with a new Shell?
- What to do with 1000 failed packages? (*To be released*)
- Epilogue (*To be released*)

## Introduction

Osh - the "compatible" part of the Oils project - is probably the newest POSIX compliant shell out there. It’s both POSIX *and* Bash compatible.

And it is already very mature. Osh runs [real shell programs](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Shell-Programs-That-Run-Under-OSH) since 2017. And the Oils repo has a *lot* of tests, benchmarks and metrics which are published on each release ([latest](https://oils.pub/release/latest/quality.html)).

So OSH can run some of the biggest publicly available shell scripts. But is this enough?
<br>Especially with shell my experience is that people typically learn a unique style of writing their code and then stick to it. Why try out a feature which could shoot you in the foot, when you can achieve the same behaviour with 5 messy lines of code you know will work when you copy them from your last script, right?
This became very apparent to me when I went through around 50 Nagios checks from "the internet" with my apprentice last year and tried to apply shellcheck to them. We saw vastly different styles and had to use an unexpected amount of `#shellcheck disable=...`!

So I believe we need to test *many different* shell scripts, rather than a few big codebases! It will happen automatically when people start adopting it, but until then we need to do that work ourselves.

### Searching for Shell Scripts

Shell is a sneaky language. Just recently, I learned that the line `VirusEvent mycommand` in a [Clamav](https://www.clamav.net/) config file will execute the command `$USER_SHELL -c 'mycommand'` when it finds a Virus. Not just `mycommand`. This means I could also do something crazy like `VirusEvent for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; done; echo "VIRUS!"` (as long as my shell supports this)! Shell is "embedded" like that in many places.
The most prominent and heavy use of this is in `Makefile`s, which shell out for almost any command:

```make
mytarget:
	echo this is shell

secondtarget:
	# We can do the same thing as in the Clamav VirusEvent
	for i in a b c; do echo $i; done
```

Therefore, it’s not a far stretch to start *building packages* when we want to run a lot of shell, because building packages usually involves `Makefile`s.
Not only are there `Makefile`s, but also huge `configure` scripts written (or generated!) in shell. And Alpine Linux "Aports" are even *package definitions* written in shell! And it turns out there are package testing tools written in shell, too!
So we’ll definitely get a few different styles of shell, when we build packages.

That’s why I started that project to build all Aports using Oils as build shell.

## The Setup

Before we can build packages, we need the package definitions. Since Alpine Linux keeps them all in the official [Aports repo](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads), we can just clone that repository.

I actually created a fork, to store any custom tooling in the same repository. But to make potential rebasing easy, I created a folder `oily` in the repository and put everything in there. If you’re curious, you can [check it out](https://github.com/Melkor333/oily-pine/tree/master/oily) after finishing this blog (series). :)

### Containers

To build Alpine packages, we need to set up a build environment. There are a few build environment options for that:
- A virtual machine with Alpine Linux
- An Alpine container image
- A chroot

Using a container is probably the easiest way to get started, so I picked that.

To build a container image, we need a `Containerfile`. It's literally the same as a `Dockerfile`, but I use `podman` instead of Docker and that wants the more generic name.

```dockerfile
# oily/container/Containerfile

from alpine:latest

ADD setup-build-env.sh /bin/setup-build-env.sh
RUN setup-build-env.sh

USER packager
WORKDIR /home/packager
VOLUME ["/home/packager/aports"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/home/packager/aports/oily/container/package.sh"]
```

This file does not do much:
- Start from an Alpine linux base container
- Run the `setup-build-env.sh`
- Set some variables on how a container with this image should be executed

The (not so) hard work is in the `setup-build-env.sh`. It downloads and installs Oils (which is in the testing repository), creates a `packager` user, gives it the required permissions and creates some folders/softlinks:

```shell
# oily/container/setup-build-env.sh

# oils-* is only in the testing repos...
echo https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing >> /etc/apk/repositories
apk add abuild abuild-rootbld doas build-base alpine-sdk oils-for-unix oils-for-unix-binsh oils-for-unix-bash lua-aports
# Delete the testing repo again
sed -i '/testing/d' /etc/apk/repositories

# wheel group should be able to run `doas` without password
echo 'permit nopass :wheel' > /etc/doas.conf

adduser -Du 1000 packager
adduser packager abuild
adduser packager wheel

mkdir -p /home/packager/aports
# Create softlinks to keep artifacts
ln -s /home/packager/aports/oily/abuild /home/packager/.abuild
ln -s /home/packager/aports/oily/logs /home/packager/logs
ln -s /home/packager/aports/oily/packages /home/packager/packages
chown -R packager /home/packager

# Remove the cache of installed packages to make the container smaller
apk cache clean --purge
```

Since we will mount our repository with `VOLUME ["/home/packager/aports"]`, anything put inside of that folder while in the container will actually be stored in the repository and thus available outside of the container.
The softlinks make sure later generated signing key, logs and built packages will be stored in the repo.

### The Oils Package

My script installs 3 `oils-*` packages:
- oils-for-unix
- oils-for-unix-binsh
- oils-for-unix-bash

This is because I was very considerate when creating the [Aport definition](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/70331):

The package `oils-for-unix` creates the actual binary `/usr/bin/oils-for-unix` and 2 symlinks `/usr/bin/osh` and `/usr/bin/ysh`, both pointing to `/usr/bin/oils-for-unix`. Executing `osh` will start a bash-compatible shell, while `ysh` starts Oils with all the feature flags for a modern shell enabled.

| This usage of symlinks to change behaviour is nothing special. When executed via the symlink, the `ARGV[0]` of the executable is set to the name of the symlink. The executable can then use this to change its behaviour. Probably the most famous binary doing this is [busybox](https://busybox.net/), which supports many coreutils tools like `cp`, `ls` and even `grep` and `awk` - all in a single binary. And while we're at it, Busybox also provides the default shell in Alpine Linux that way. The package `busybox-binsh` installs the softlink `/bin/sh -> /bin/busybox`. Oils uses this feature to either start in POSIX or Ysh "compatibility modes". |

---

The only content of the package `oils-for-unix-binsh` is a symlink `/bin/sh -> /usr/bin/oils-for-unix`. It also provides the additional "virtual package" called `/bin/sh`, a *path*. This is probably the weirdest package name I've ever seen!

<table style="table-layout: fixed">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
          <h2 class="no_toc">What's a virtual package?</h2>
          <span markdown="1">

A "virtual package" is like a group of packages all providing the same or similar function. These packages usually install exactly the same file and therefore can't be installed at the same time. That's the case with `busybox-binsh` and `oils-for-unix-binsh`, which both provide the file (and virtual package!) `/bin/sh`. 

          </span><br />
          <span markdown="1">

So if I do `apk add /bin/sh` I tell `apk` that I don't care about the exact package, as long as there is some package which *provides* the virtual package `/bin/sh`. It will install `busybox-binsh` (if not yet installed) because this has the highest `provider_priority` ([100](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/blob/master/main/busybox/APKBUILD#L328)). My `oils-for-unix-binsh` will be ignored, because it has only a priority of 10:

          </span>
          {% highlight shell %}
# Package definition of oils-for-unix-binsh
binsh() {
	pkgdesc="oils-for-unix as /bin/sh"
	provides="/bin/sh"
	provider_priority=10 # lowest (other providers: dash-binsh, busybox-binsh, yash-binsh)

	mkdir -p "$subpkgdir"/bin
	ln -s /usr/bin/oils-for-unix "$subpkgdir"/bin/sh
}
          {% endhighlight %}
          <span markdown="1">
If I - after installing `/bin/sh` - run the command `apk add oils-for-unix-binsh`, it will first remove `busybox-binsh` and then install `oils-for-unix-binsh`.
          </span>


</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

`oils-for-unix-bash` is like to the `...-binsh` package, except it conflicts with the `bash` package instead of `busybox-binsh`, as it creates a symlink `/bin/bash -> /usr/bin/oils-for-unix`. We could provide a virtual package `/bin/bash` to solve this conflict. But I learned that both packages implicitly provide the virtual package `cmd:bash`. This is because they install an executable file `bash`, and `apk` seems to create a virtual package for each file in `/bin/`.

| I'm honestly not sure why we had to use the `/bin/sh` virtual package previously, when there's already a `cmd:sh` package. I assume this is for historical reasons. |

### Signing Packages

Remember the last line in the Containerfile?:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/home/packager/aports/oily/container/package.sh"]
```

It points to a script which should be executed when we start the container. This script does only 2 things:

```shell
# oily/container/package.sh

# Generate or reuse an existing apk signing key
../setup-key.sh

# Build all packages
buildrepo -k -l "$HOME/logs" ./main
buildrepo -k -l "$HOME/logs" ./community
buildrepo -k -l "$HOME/logs" ./testing
```


The `buildrepo` script is a (shell) script written by the Alpine folks to build a whole set of packages from the `aports` code repository. Alpine linux knows 3 different "official" package sets, and for each repository there is a separate folder in the repository. This path is just given to the `buildrepo` command as the last argument.

And the `setup-key.sh` file is a short, funny script that I wrote:

```shell
# oily/setup-key.sh

source "$HOME/.abuild/abuild.conf" || true

# generate a key if not existent
if [ -z "$PACKAGER_PRIVKEY" ]; then
    echo "generating new key and configfile"
    abuild-keygen -na --install
else
    echo "using $PACKAGER_PRIVKEY"
    doas cp "$PACKAGER_PRIVKEY".pub /etc/apk/keys
fi
```

So first it tries to source the file `$HOME/.abuild/abuild.conf` (which, with the symlink, should reside in the repository under `oily/abuild`).
That file, when created, looks something like this:

```shell
# oily/abuild/abuild.conf

PACKAGER_PRIVKEY="/home/packager/.abuild/-68ce4406.rsa"
```

It has the file ending `conf`, but it is just a shell script in disguise. :)
(You can ignore the weird rsa key name. We don't care about that).

So when config file doesn't exist yet, it generates both a key and a matching config file.
If a file already exists, it copies the pubkey to the folder `/etc/apk/keys`.

<table style="table-layout: fixed">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
          <span markdown="1">

Copying the key to `/etc/apk/keys` is not necessary. When abuild finishes a package build, it signs the package and puts it into `$HOME/packages`.
Now if we want to install that generated package, it fails:

          </span>
          {% highlight shell-session %}
ysh-0.34$ doas apk add /home/packager/packages/main/x86_64/bzip2-1.0.8-r6.apk
ERROR: /home/packager/packages/main/x86_64/bzip2-1.0.8-r6.apk: UNTRUSTED signature
  doas apk add /home/packager/packages/main/x86_64/bzip2-1.0.8-r6.apk
  ^~~~
[ interactive ]:8: errexit PID 1: Command failed with status 99
          {% endhighlight %}
          <span markdown="1">
The reason is that `apk` will compare the signing key with the keys in the folder `/etc/apk/keys`. If it doesn't have the key, then it's considered untrusted.
So when we copy the key to `/etc/apk/keys`, `apk` knows that this package is trusted. We could also not copy the key and do `apk --allow-untrusted`.
          </span>

</tr>

</table>

For a bit of an overview, the file hierarchy of the git repo looks like this:
- oily-pine `# In the container this is /home/packager/aports/`
  - main/ `# package definitions of the main repo`
  - community/ `# package definitions of the community repo`
  - testing/ `# package definitions of the testing repo`
  - oily/
    - container.sh `# Holds functions to build/run the container`
    - container/
      - Containerfile
      - Dockerfile `# A softlink to the Containerfile so it works with Docker as well`
      - setup-build-env.sh
      - package.sh
    - abuild/ `# Keeps the abuild.conf file and key between executions`
    - logs/ `# build logs`
    - packages/ `# finished packages. We could also throw them away...`
{: .tree }

## Building Packages

The only missing piece from the folder structure is the code to actually build and run a container!

```shell
# simplified version of oily/container.sh

cd $GIT_ROOT

build() {
  podman build --network=host oily/container/ -t oily-pine-builder
}

package() {
  podman run --rm -v ./:/home/packager/aports oily-pine-builder
}
```
I had some issues with IPv4/6, so I told podman to use the host network with `--network=host`.

And since we'll store all outputs in the repository, we can use `--rm` to remove the container right away. We only need to make sure we mount the current folder properly.

Let’s build and run that Container!

```shell-session
$ ./oily/container.sh build
STEP 1/7: FROM alpine:latest
STEP 2/7: ADD setup-build-env.sh /bin/setup-build-env.sh
STEP 3/7: RUN setup-build-env.sh

**WE’RE BUILDING!**

Now there were [**A LOT**](https://github.com/Melkor333/oily-pine-logs/blob/master/25-05-16_15%3A04-buildrepo.log) of these `oils: PID xxx exited, but oils didn't start it` warnings, but (most of) the packages built successfully. :)
The above snippet also shows how it looks when the package `expat` fails.

And with that we have the baseline to build *all alpine Linux packages*! Or so I thought :)

## Doing A First Build

Putting this all together required quite some time, so when it first ran, I was *very* excited.
I was so excited, that I wrote a script which monitored the output and sent me an hourly update to my phone with [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/):

![Notifications on the phone showing increasing number of packages]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2025-08-15_11-45-29-oils-notifications.png){:height="600px"}
IIRC it was compiling GCC between 00:00-06:00 that day, which just took some time on my very old server.

The builds ran and ran and ran. They had to be restarted a few times due to different minor issues like a package causing an actual infinite loop. At some point I ran it 3 times with a slight adjustment to build main, test and community at in parallel instead of serially. `buildrepo` has that convenient characteristics that when a build successfully finishes, it doesn't build it again in a future run. So I could just restart the script whenever I wanted and it would only retry the failed packages.

After about 10 days the allocated 500GB disk filled up with 11999 built `.apk` files, and 5327/6500 successful Aports. 

| An interesting sidenote: It wasn't the sucessfully built packages filling up the disk! Whenever a build failed, the source files were not deleted. This could be the unpacked source tarball, generated intermediate files as well as binaries, depending on the package and where it failed. The built `apk`s themselves were only a few GB in size. |

82% success rate in a first attempt isn’t all too bad. I hoped for 95% (mainly because it looked like that for the first ~1000 builds), but I think it's OK given that a single bug could affect many packages.

## Coming Up...

And that's it for this article.
I showed you how to build Alpine Linux packages and even showed how I did a first build.

The next article in this series will go into detail on what I did with the 1173 failed packages.
